[NASA's Black Marble](https://blackmarble.gsfc.nasa.gov/)

**Black Marble** is a set of **satellite-derived nighttime lights products** that map **artificial light on Earth at night** using data from the **VIIRS Day/Night Band (DNB)** sensor onboard the **Suomi-NPP and NOAA-20 satellites**.

It provides **calibrated, cloud-filtered, corrected nighttime radiance data** suitable for scientific analysis rather than just pretty pictures. The products are designed so researchers can quantitatively study how night lights vary across space and time.

NASA’s Black Marble product suite includes multiple data products at different time scales:

| Product | What It Shows |
| --- | --- |
| **VNP46A1** | Daily at-sensor nighttime radiance |
| **VNP46A2** | Daily moonlight-adjusted night lights |
| **VNP46A3** | Monthly aggregated, gap-filled night lights |
| **VNP46A4** | Annual aggregated, gap-filled night lights |

these products are like: Raw → Cleaned → Averaged → Long-term Averaged

These products are globally gridded (e.g., 500 m resolution) and easier to work with for time-series analysis

monthly; check for 7-9 months period
